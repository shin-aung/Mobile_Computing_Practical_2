**Learning Journey: Constructing the Quicksum App**

Embarking on this Android app development journey, I, as an intermediate learner, invested approximately 3 hours in mastering the construction of the Quicksum app. The comprehensive breakdown of tasks shaped a holistic learning experience.

**Task 1 - Construct the UI (90 mins):**

Creating the project involved setting up the API level, and carefully navigating Android Studio to avoid common pitfalls. Understanding the nuances of LinearLayoutCompat and its role in UI design was pivotal. Adjusting TextView and implementing a TableLayout with TableRow and Button elements required meticulous attention to detail. Leveraging weight attributes facilitated a responsive UI, and the incorporation of a predefined Android style enhanced the app's aesthetics.

**Task 2 - Setup the Button Handler (60 mins):**

This phase provided insights into event handling. The decision to utilize the onClick attribute on buttons and linking them to a common method, "buttonClicked" in MainActivity.java, streamlined the code. The downcasting of the view to a Button and converting button text to an integer demonstrated a practical application of event-driven programming.

**Task 3 - Improve Quicksum (90 mins):**

Enhancing the app's work efficiency became a focal point. Addressing yellow warnings in XML and Java files, excluding onClick attributes, contributed to code cleanliness. Exploring string resource extraction improved code readability and maintenance. The addition of a clear button necessitated a thoughtful approach to avoid code duplication, encouraging me to practice code refactoring techniques.

**Total Time Taken: Approximately 3 hours**

**Self-Reflection (150 words):**

Engaging in this three-hour practical exercise was both intellectually stimulating and rewarding. The UI construction demanded a meticulous approach, emphasizing the importance of proper layout management in Android app development. Setting up the button handler was a valuable lesson in managing user interactions effectively, showcasing the significance of event-driven programming in creating responsive apps.
